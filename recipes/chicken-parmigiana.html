    <h3>Chicken parmesan or chicken parmigiana (Italian: pollo alla parmigiana) is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, Parmesan, or provolone. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added.</h3>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Mixed herbs</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic and onion</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

        <li>Schnitzel thin chicken takes 4 minutes max to cook through so it’s golden and crispy on the outside, and just cooked on the inside. In fact, it doesn’t matter if it’s not cooked through because it will definitely finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Top with sauce, covering about 80% of the surface (leaving some crunchy exposed bits!). At this stage, I also like to sprinkle with a bit of</li>
    </ol>
